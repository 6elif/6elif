      3 month - Make 4 Landing Pages (with JS, HTML and CSS)
      4 month - Learn React JS - Start applying for jobs
      5 month - Make 2 or 3 big applications with React JS - Learn to use the GitHub and the terminal
      6 month - Learn working with databases (basics) - learn a little PHP - and start doing LEETCODE.
